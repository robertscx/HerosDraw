# HerosDraw

Hero's Draw is a PVE card game where Inscryption meets Gwent with a new way of summoning cards. The game is set in a medieval fantasy world filled with knights, magicians, vampires, and dragons.

The game currently consists of a tutorial, deck builder, level progression, and infinitely generated AI battles, with hopes to expand into a full-on story.

The game is inspired by the summoning field and combat of Inscryption, with the mechanic of players taking turns playing each card from Gwent to create a new dimension of strategy when battling opponents.

The Player will compete in battles trying to reduce the opponent's HP down to 0 by using mana to summon cards to fight for them. Even if the player loses, they can still continue to play the game. However, you'll be rewarded with a card if you win, so try your best to win.

The game revolves around risk and reward. As the game develops, you must build your deck so you can be the Hero of the story.

Do you have what it takes to become the card Hero?


Hero's Draw was created in Unity and coded in C#.
